/**
 * One of the ways how this mostly statistical site could be brought closer to the visitors is to show the "face" of the captives
 * Unfortunately there are no images were taken, but someone's face is much more than his/her skull covered by tissues
 * in same cases showing the user a person in the same age, from the same location could probably make the interaction with the site more personal
 *
 * user will be able to enter location, age, sex
 * app will return someone from the db based on these attributes.
